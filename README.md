Another Weather App

Thank you for downloading the basic weather app. This app allows you to enter any city and get the weather for it thanks to the OpenWeather API. It will also show you the wind speed, direction, the time of sunrise and sunset. There is also a dark mode option at the top right of the page.


NOTE: The OpenWeather API requires a key and there is a hidden file which is what allows the GET request to work.
